# Assassin's Creed Mirage Review: A Return to Form with Caveats

Assassin's Creed Mirage takes the series back to its roots with a focus on stealth, parkour, and a smaller, denser open world. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

## Positives:

- **Return to Classic Gameplay:** Fans of the early AC titles will appreciate the emphasis on social stealth, crowd manipulation, and strategic assassinations.
- **Vivid 9th Century Baghdad:** The bustling city setting offers a vibrant atmosphere and diverse environments to explore.
- **Compelling Protagonist:** Basim's journey from street urchin to skilled assassin is well-written and engaging.
- **Streamlined Experience:** The smaller scope helps avoid open-world fatigue and keeps the focus on core gameplay mechanics.
- **Improved Combat:** More responsive and balanced combat compared to recent RPG-heavy installments.

## Negatives:

- **Limited Content:** The shorter campaign and smaller world might feel restrictive for players accustomed to vast open worlds.
- **Repetitive Side Activities:** While plentiful, some find side quests and collectibles lacking variety.
- **Technical Issues:** Some PC players have reported bugs and performance issues.
- **Price Point:** Some consider the $50 price tag a little high for the shorter experience.

## Overall:

Assassin's Creed Mirage delivers a refreshing return to the series' stealthy origins. Fans of the early games will likely be thrilled, while newcomers might find the experience less expansive than recent entries. While some technical issues and repetitiveness hold it back slightly, the core gameplay loop and setting are solid.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- Are you a fan of the classic Assassin's Creed style with a focus on stealth and smaller levels?
- Does a shorter, more focused campaign appeal to you, or do you prefer vast open worlds?
- Are you sensitive to potential technical issues and repetitiveness in side activities?
- Do you find the $50 price tag reasonable for the offered experience?

By considering these points and your own gaming preferences, you can decide whether Assassin's Creed Mirage is a game for you.
